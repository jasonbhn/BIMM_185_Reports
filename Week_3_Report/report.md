# Report_Week_3
```
This week we explored various bioinformatics related topics under the major theme of protein translatability modeling. 
The whole thing involved some essential knowledge about protein translation,, which mainly included codon usage and its relation to the tRNA concentration by type, which could be well correlated to the translatability and expressivity of 
certain amino acid; one of the bigger picture in our mind, ultimately, is to jump from the translatability of ones' own
gene to the translatability of foreign gene in a certain native genome. If a good model is deployed, we can use it to 
optimize the production of certain biosynthetic compound using standard organism like E. coli.

So let's break it down into essential knowledge on the translatability mechanism part and the technical part(programming).
