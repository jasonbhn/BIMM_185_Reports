#Report 2

```
This week we did 3 main mini projects using Python and Bash.
```
#zscore.sh
```
The first thing we did is traversing through a complex directory and extract information z-score and protein name from the file in the innermost directory. 
The script is stored in zscore.sh
This is a good demonstration of the use of regex and pipelining. 
Traversal through files could be very important. 
This traversal could also be used to make table, like a csv file where you grab a locus tag and protein name and some coordinates and put them in one file. You can also grab the conserved regions across multiple genomes. And you can generate a file for blast or similarity test. 
The code could also be used to extract some files from a folder and concatenate to generate a report. Such as the case here, where we would, instead of grabing the info in report file, take report file as a whole and concatenate the report one after another. Maybe by passing this into a mathematical program, we can generate statistics of the genomes or genes.
